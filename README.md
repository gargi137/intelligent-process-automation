# Intelligent-Process-Automation
This project is about using AI to  automate repetitive and time-consuming business processes, such as data entry, document processing, and customer service interactions.


**Overview**
Intelligent Process Automation applies cutting-edge AI and machine learning techniques to automate business processes. The following algorithms and tools have been implemented:

**Data Entry Automation**: Utilizes Tesseract OCR for optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from images. Regular expressions are employed for structured data extraction, and data is stored and managed in an SQL database to streamline data entry workflows.

**Document Processing Automation**: Applies OCR (alternative to Tesseract) to extract textual data from documents, followed by categorization and basic text analysis.

**Customer Service Automation**: Implements a chatbot using a rule-based system to handle customer queries, automating responses based on predefined inputs.
