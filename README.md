# Intelligent-Process-Automation


This project addresses key challenges that enterprises face in automating their repetitive and error-prone tasks, enabling them to increase operational efficiency and drive business growth. In industries where large-scale data processing, document handling, and customer interaction are central, automation can drastically improve outcomes. The implementation of Tesseract OCR for data entry not only accelerates the data intake process but also minimizes human error, allowing for more accurate and reliable data handling. The use of SQL databases facilitates seamless data storage and retrieval, enhancing both performance and scalability. Document processing automation further optimizes business workflows by reducing the need for manual review and categorization of documents, saving valuable time and resources. Finally, chatbot-driven customer service automation helps businesses scale their support operations, providing real-time responses to customers while lowering operational costs. These solutions ultimately enable enterprises to focus on strategic growth, enhance customer experience, and remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market.


##Overview


Intelligent Process Automation applies cutting-edge AI and machine learning techniques to automate business processes. The following algorithms and tools have been implemented:

####**Data Entry Automation**: Utilizes Tesseract OCR for optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from images. Regular expressions are employed for structured data extraction, and data is stored and managed in an SQL database to streamline data entry workflows.

####**Document Processing Automation**: Applies OCR (alternative to Tesseract) to extract textual data from documents, followed by categorization and basic text analysis.

####**Customer Service Automation**: Implements a chatbot using a rule-based system to handle customer queries, automating responses based on predefined inputs.
